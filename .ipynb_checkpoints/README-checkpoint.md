# NERSC DOE HPC Bootcamp 2025

Welcome to the repository for the **NERSC DOE High-Performance Computing (HPC) Bootcamp 2025**, designed to prepare participants for real-world performance analysis and sustainable computing practices across scientific domains.

This bootcamp includes two distinct project pathways — **Fusion Energy Research** and **Energy Efficiency & Sustainability** — both of which build upon a shared foundation of Modules 1–4.

---

## 🔍 Overview

This repository is organized around two capstone project tracks:

- **Project 1: Fusion Energy Research** – Analyze HPC workloads related to plasma simulation, resource utilization, and optimization of fusion applications.
- **Project 2: Energy Efficiency and Sustainability** – Investigate power metrics, carbon impact, and propose strategies for reducing energy usage in scientific computing.

All participants complete Modules 1–4 before branching into their assigned project-specific Module 5.
